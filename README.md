# CSCA-5632-Final: Book Recommendation System Using Unsupervised Learning

## Project Overview

This project aims to build a book recommendation system using unsupervised machine learning techniques. The dataset for this project is sourced from [Kaggle's Book Recommendation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/book-recommendation-dataset/data). The goal is to recommend books to users based on the data available.

## Introduction

In this project, we will develop a book recommendation system using unsupervised learning techniques. The primary aim is to explore different models and approaches to provide personalized book recommendations to users based on the available dataset. The focus will be on model building, training, and evaluation, ensuring that the methods are tailored to handle the dataset's characteristics.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is obtained from Kaggle and includes information about books, users, and their interactions. The dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/book-recommendation-dataset/data).

## Methodology

### Step 1: Gather Data

- **Objective:** Select a data source and problem.
- **Data Source:** [Kaggle Book Recommendation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/book-recommendation-dataset/data).
- **Provenance:** The dataset is collected and shared by Arash Nick on Kaggle. It includes user ratings, book details, and user demographic information.
- **Discussion:** The dataset is suitable for building a recommendation system as it provides comprehensive information about user interactions with books.

### Step 2: Identify an Unsupervised Learning Problem

- **Objective:** Focus on model building and training using unsupervised learning techniques.
- **Approach:** Use clustering algorithms to identify patterns and similarities among books and users.
- **Models to Explore:** K-Means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, DBSCAN, etc.
- **Additional Research:** Explore research papers and existing algorithms to enhance model performance and comparison.

### Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Objective:** Inspect, visualize, and clean the data to prepare it for modeling.
- **Procedures:**
  - **Data Description:** Describe factors (features) such as book titles, authors, user ratings, etc.
  - **Visualizations:** Use box-plots, scatter plots, histograms to describe data distribution.
  - **Correlation Analysis:** Identify correlations between different factors.
  - **Data Transformation:** Normalize or scale data if necessary.
  - **Outlier Detection:** Identify and handle outliers or missing values.
  - **Feature Importance:** Hypothesize which factors might be more important for the recommendation system.

### Step 4: Perform Analysis Using Unsupervised Learning Models

- **Objective:** Build and train models, compare their performance, and present findings.
- **Models to Use:**
  - **K-Means Clustering:** Group similar books based on user ratings and other features.
  - **Hierarchical Clustering:** Create a hierarchy of book clusters.
  - **DBSCAN:** Identify dense regions in the dataset for clustering.
- **Hyperparameter Optimization:** Tune model parameters to achieve optimal performance.
- **Comparison and Evaluation:** Compare models and justify their performance and limitations.

## Conclusions

- Summarize the findings from different models.
- Discuss the best-performing model and its implications.
- Highlight any challenges faced and how they were addressed.
- Provide suggestions for future work or improvements.
